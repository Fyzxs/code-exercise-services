[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4acske7n20xws4oi/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Fyzxs/code-exercise-services/branch/master)

This is a code exercise. It'll be a component of a continuing discussion. It'll have specific emphasis on SOLID principles, which for me means following what I've laid out about [MicroObjects](https://quinngil.com/uobjects/).


## Building Locally
* Use Visual Studio

## Existing CI System
* CI is via AppVeyor and is [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Fyzxs/code-exercise-services). This may not be publicly available yet.

## Usage
* Get the latest artifact from [here](TODO:LINK_ME)
* Execute from the command line as follows
* * `blah blah blah`
* * Also available as `blah -help` or `blah -?`

## Contributing
Don't.
I'm using this to demonstrate and discuss my coding technique.
